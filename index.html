      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi I'm Josh, a full stack developer from California currently based in Charlotte, North Carolina.
            I've recently completed a range of web development and computer engineering certifications in full stack developement as well as cloud computing, AI systems, and data analytics. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I have always had interest in web development and working in tech and I am looking to break in to this field and hit the ground running and make an immediate imact at my position. Front-end development is personally my favorite aspect of the development process, the challenges that come along with creating interactive and user friendly sites as well as how elements are interacted with by clients and users is always a fun and welcomed challenge!</p>
        <br>
        <p>When I'm not working on projects in VS Code I like to build and prototype new builds with my 3D printer, producing music, as well as watching esports! I like to bet on myself and constantly add new tools to my belt to be a better designer, developer, and overall person.  </p>
